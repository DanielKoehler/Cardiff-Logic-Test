Cardiff-Logic-Test
==================

A project for Quality Software Development developing a piece of software with a logic reasoning test and questionnaire for use at a careers fair.

Scenario
============
> Your team has been asked by COMSC to develop a stand alone package to assist staff during these career fairs and other outreach events with Secondary Schools and Colleges. 

> The School of Computer Science & Informatics requires an application that allows a pupil to undertake an interactive informal logic reasoning test.  Your prototype should consist of two types of questions selected from the example logic reasoning test available on Learning Central. Prior to taking the actual logic reasoning test the software should allow the pupils to have a practice attempt at each type of question once the instructions have been explained. The actual test should consist of at most two or three questions of each type. The system should provide pupils with immediate feedback on their attempts at the practice questions and final test. 

> In addition, the package should include a questionnaire made up of 10 questions. The aim of the questionnaire is to see if pupils have aptitude and skills that are useful for one of our degree programmes and therefore may want to consider a degree at COMSC. 

> A list of pupils interested in degrees in COMSC including contact details (optional) should be stored for later use.
